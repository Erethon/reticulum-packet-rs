* reticulum-packet-rs
** Overview
An *unofficial* and very proof-of-concept library to parse/decode [[https://reticulum.network/][Reticulum]]
packets in Rust. Treat this is a quick and dirty hack.

** Here be dragons
The packets to be parsed need to be provided as a Vec<u8> and need to not be
stripped of any escaping. For now it only supports HDLC frames and the
parsing of the packets is minimal.

It contains ugly hacks for which I'm sure there are better idiomatic Rust
approaches I'm not familiar with. For now it has zero dependencies, but things
like [[https://github.com/bitflags/bitflags][bitflags]] might be added.
