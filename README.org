* reticulum-packet-rs
** Overview
An *unofficial* and very proof-of-concept library to parse/decode [[https://reticulum.network/][Reticulum]]
packets in Rust. Treat this is a quick and dirty hack.

** Here be dragons
For now it can only decode packets from the [[https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/interfaces.html#pipe-interface][Pipe Interface]] and assumes the
packet is already stripped from any HDCL start/end bytes *but* is not escaped!
A lot of things are hardcoded for it to work with the Pipe interface, but it
should be possible to modularize this in the future.

It contains ugly hacks for which I'm sure there are better idiomatic Rust
approaches I'm not familiar with. For now it has zero dependencies, but things
like [[https://github.com/bitflags/bitflags][bitflags]] might be added.
